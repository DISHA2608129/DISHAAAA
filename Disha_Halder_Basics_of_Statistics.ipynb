It describes qualities or characteristics and is often used to categorize or label attributes of a population. For example, the colors of cars in a parking lot (red, blue, black), types of cuisine (Italian, Chinese, Indian), or customer feedback such as \"satisfied\" or \"unsatisfied\" are all forms of qualitative data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantitative data, on the other hand, is numerical and can be measured or counted. This type of data reflects quantities or amounts and can be subjected to mathematical operations. Examples of quantitative data include a person's age (30 years), the number of products sold in a store (150 units), or the temperature in a city (22°C).\n",

        "The ordinal scale provides a ranking or ordering of items, but the intervals between the values are not necessarily equal. An example is a customer satisfaction survey with options like “very satisfied,” “satisfied,” “neutral,” “dissatisfied,” and “very dissatisfied.” While there is a clear order, the difference between the satisfaction levels is not uniformly measurable.\n",

        "The interval scale includes ordered categories that are evenly spaced, but it lacks a true zero point. Temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit is a good example. The difference between 20°C and 30°C is the same as between 30°C and 40°C, but 0°C does not indicate the absence of temperature.\n",

        "Measures of central tendency are statistical tools used to summarize a set of data by identifying the central point within that data. The three main measures are mean, median, and mode, and each serves a different purpose depending on the nature of the data and the context of analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The mean, often referred to as the average, is calculated by adding up all the values in a data set and dividing the total by the number of values. For example, if five students scored 70, 75, 80, 85, and 90 on a test, the mean score would be (70 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90) ÷ 5 = 80. The mean is best used when the data set is numeric, evenly distributed, and not affected by extreme values. However, in cases with outliers or skewed data, the mean can be misleading. For example, in a small company where most employees earn around £30,000 but the CEO earns £500,000, the mean salary will be disproportionately high and not representative of the majority.\n",
        "\n",
        "The median is the middle value in an ordered data set. If there is an odd number of values, the median is the one in the middle; if even, it is the average of the two middle numbers. Taking the earlier example (70, 75, 80, 85, 90), the median is 80. If the data were (70, 75, 80, 85), the median would be (75 + 80) ÷ 2 = 77.5. The median is especially useful when dealing with skewed data or outliers, as it provides a better representation of central tendency than the mean. For instance, when analyzing household income or property prices in a region, the median gives a more realistic picture of what a typical household earns or spends.\n",
        "\n",
        "The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. A set of shoe sizes like 6, 7, 8, 8, 9 would have a mode of 8. The mode is the only measure of central tendency that can be used with nominal data, such as the most popular brand of cereal or the most common eye color. It is also helpful in understanding data distributions where multiple values occur with high frequency, and especially when identifying the most typical or frequent item in a category."

For example, if two classes have the same average test score, but one class has a few students with very high or low scores, it will have a higher variance than a class where most students scored close to the average.\n",

        "\n",
        "Skewness: If the median line is not in the center of the box, or if one whisker is noticeably longer, it indicates that the data is skewed. For example, a longer right whisker suggests right (positive) skewness.\n",

        "Random sampling plays a crucial role in making accurate and reliable inferences about populations in statistics. It refers to the process of selecting a subset of individuals from a larger population in such a way that every member of the population has an equal chance of being chosen. This method helps ensure that the sample is representative of the population, which is essential for drawing valid conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main role of random sampling is to reduce bias. If a sample is selected randomly, it is less likely to be influenced by conscious or unconscious choices that could skew the results. For instance, if a researcher only surveys people in a single neighbourhood to understand national voting intentions, the sample may not reflect the diversity of the broader population. Random sampling, however, increases the likelihood that different demographics, attitudes, and characteristics are fairly represented.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another key benefit is that random sampling supports the application of probability theory, which is foundational for inferential statistics. This means researchers can calculate margins of error and confidence intervals and perform hypothesis testing, all of which help estimate population parameters based on sample data.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, suppose a company wants to understand customer satisfaction across the country. It would be impractical to survey every single customer. Instead, they might randomly sample 1,000 customers and analyze their feedback. If the sampling is truly random, the company can reasonably infer that the satisfaction levels in the sample reflect those of the entire customer base, within a known margin of error.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, random sampling is essential because it enables researchers and analysts to make generalizations about a population with a known level of confidence, without needing to collect data from every single member. It enhances fairness, supports statistical rigor, and ensures that conclusions drawn are both meaningful and credible."

In an ideal (symmetrical) distribution, such as a normal distribution, the left and right sides are mirror images of each other, with the mean, median, and mode all equal. However, in real-world data, this symmetry is often not present, and skewness helps quantify the direction and degree of that asymmetry.\n",

In a positively skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median, and the median is greater than the mode.\n",

        "Here, the tail on the left side is longer or more spread out. Most of the data points are clustered at the higher end, but some extremely low values pull the tail to the left. In a negatively skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median, and the median is less than the mode.\n",
        "Example: The age at retirement—most people retire around 60–65, but some retire much earlier, creating a left-skew.\n",

        "Skewness can distort measures of central tendency, especially the mean, which is sensitive to extreme values. In skewed data, relying solely on the mean can give a misleading impression of the \"typical\" value. For example, if salaries are right-skewed, the average salary might appear high, even though most people earn less than that amount.\n",
        "\n",
        "Skewness also affects statistical modeling. Many statistical tests, like the t-test or regression analysis, assume normally distributed (symmetrical) data. If the data is heavily skewed, these tests may not perform correctly, and transformations or non-parametric methods might be necessary.\n",
        "\n",

        "A random variable is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon or experiment. It is a function that assigns a real number to each possible outcome in the sample space of a probabilistic event. Essentially, a random variable is a way to quantify the possible outcomes of a random experiment.\n",

        "There are two main types of random variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Discrete Random Variable:\n",
        "A discrete random variable is a type of random variable that can take on only a finite or countably infinite number of distinct values. These values are separate and distinct, and there are no intermediate values between them. Discrete random variables are typically counted.\n",

        "A continuous random variable is a type of random variable that can take on any value within a given range or interval.
